## Multimedia Degree Requirements (34 units)

### Required Core Courses

The following 17 units of core coursework is required:

__MM 601__ - Theory and Practice of Multimedia Units: 3

  > Advanced reading and discussion of the foundational literature, principles and paradigms associated with the study of media art, culture, and communication. Course covers the history, methods and terminology of media art.


__MM 602__ - Project and Story Development Units: 3

  > Small development projects to develop students’ potential to succeed as members of a thesis team. Establishment of research project teams and the development of thesis proposals.

__MM 640__ - Forum Units: 1 (must be taken four times, once each semester for a total of 4 units)

  > Advanced practitioners at the intersections of art, science, and technology present and discuss their work in a dynamic and open format with students.Students are actively engaged in a conversation about current trends and paradigms in contemporary media.

__MM 680__ - Interactive Content Development Units: 3

  > Team-based interactive content development and management with work on faculty-derived projects. Students synthesize and apply skills in a production environment, then critique and refine processes to optimize creative productivity

__MM 682__ - Individual Multimedia Research and Practice Units: 3

  > A series of structured and customized individual research and development modules designed to prepare each student for the capstone project. Socially responsible practice and professional standards of sophistication and productivity are emphasized.

__MM 694__ - Project Documentation Units: 1 (this course will be taken twice; once in the first semester of the second year and again as part of the capstone experience.)
  > Writing clear, complete, structured and persuasive documentation of multimedia projects for production, publication, promotion and/or grant applications. Professional and effective use of supporting graphics, charts, citation and bibliographies.

### Interaction Design Concentration

Interaction Design, for 17 units, focuses on the creation of meaningful experiences expressed as interactive applications and objects. Students analyze interactivity in art, design, and everyday life; acquire skills and develop prototypes; and work in collaborative teams to creatively solve real world problems.

### Interaction Design Core

Two (2) courses for 6 units are required:

__MM 621__ - Screen Based Interaction Units: 3

  > Study of the process of designing screen based interactive prototypes within the contexts of apps, games, the web. Students use various tools, including simple scripting, to create prototypes and then test and refine them.

__MM 622__ - Physical Prototyping Units: 3

  > Explore interactivity with physical objects. Study of the process of designing interactive prototypes, both autonomous and networked. Students use various tools, including simple scripting, 3D printing and microcontrollers, to create prototypes and then test and refine them.

### Interaction Design Electives
Choose two (2) electives for 6 units:

__MM 665__ - Experiments in Interactivity Units: 3
  > This course has a different topic or theme each semester and can be repeated, subject to advisor approval. Experimental studio course in application of technology to interactive experience design.Explores concepts of structure, aesthetics and content of interactive experience design.

__MM 666__ - Experiments in Art and Technology Units: 3
  > This course has a different topic or theme each semester and can be repeated, subject to advisor approval. Experimental studio course explores the territory at the intersection of the technical, scientific, entertainment and fine arts communities.

__MM 667__ - Experiments in Storytelling Units: 3
  > Explores various advanced-level strategies in storytelling using theory, production, and multimedia techniques and technologies. Determined by the program coordinator and thesis committee, the topics chosen will support the first project a student will complete on his/her own.

### Interaction Design Capstone

The following 5 units are required to complete the program capstone:

__MM 693__ - Interaction Design Capstone Project Units: 4
  > Synthesis culminating in a comprehensive team based thesis project under the supervision of a faculty committee. The capstone course is an opportunity for students to demonstrate their comprehensive achievements in interaction design. Students’ projects are presented in a public forum.

__MM 694__ - Project Documentation Units: 1

  > Writing clear, complete, structured and persuasive documentation of multimedia projects for production, publication, promotion and/or grant applications. Professional and effective use of supporting graphics, charts, citation and bibliographies.
