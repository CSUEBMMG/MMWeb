The Multimedia Graduate Program at California State University East Bay hosts a speaker series called the Forum to which we invite accomplished artists and media makers to speak with our graduate students about their work and research.  

The forum runs on alternate Thursday nights from 700pm to 930pm and the sessions can be broken up into presentation, and interactive segments as needed.
