## Apply for Admission

Each year, the Multimedia Graduate program accepts students from diverse disciplines. As the program is team-based, we look for artists that exhibit:

1. Significant depth of skill and craft in at least one area of digital media

    > The committee is looking for evidence of your best work in your area of digital media according to the types of artworks and pieces that are typical for that area. For instance, if your area of digital media is graphic design, the committee would be looking for your best designed pieces. Or as another example, if your primary area of digital media is audio production, the committee would be listening for your best work. How you choose to provide evidence in your portfolio of depth of skill and craft in your primary area of digital media is up to you. Keep in mind that regardless of the method you choose, it should communicate your intentions clearly.

2. Adequate skill and craft in a secondary area of digital media

    > The committee is looking for evidence of adequate work in a secondary area of digital media. This is quite wide and open to interpretation but just as with the evidence presented in your primary area, your presented artworks and pieces should communicate your intentions clearly.

3. Evidence of interactivity in the submitted portfolio

    > The committee is looking to see that you&rsquo;ve got some experience working with interactive media. Common forms of this are websites involving navigation or interactive widgets, Virtual or Augmented reality projects or interfaces, DVDs with menus and indexes, interactive PDFs, Flash/SWF individual projects, MAX/MSP or Pure Data projects or use of MIDI in performance, or any other medium that features reaction to minimal amounts of user input. Often, your portfolio itself is proof of this, especially if you submit your works to be viewed on a website that you designed or content management system that you modified.

### Pathways for Non-majors

For students who have compelling backgrounds in other disciplines we also offer pathways to an M.A. in Multimedia with a concentration in Interaction Design that includes additional coursework.

Based on review and consultation with the admission committee we are able to offer a __3-year program starting in the preceding fall__ to students who have the passion, but lack prior experience in production and design of interactive experiences. A three year option means that you will start in the fall semester and complete a year of preliminary courses before joining the regular cohort in the following year

On rare occasion we also offer a __2.5-year option starting each year in the spring semester__ for students who just need to brush up on their skills before starting the Fall
